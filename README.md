**dmake**

dmake is a build automation tool that I created after borking my MinGW/msys installation. As the name suggests, it is an alternative to make and cmake. See https://sites.google.com/site/tomvandijkhuizen/projects/dmake for more information and background

**Notes**

dmake relies on a serialisation library that is currently not available to the public. Said library is undergoing substantial changes and will be released upon completion.

Due to the existence of a similar product with this name, the progam will be renamed and moved to a different repository in the near future. This repository will likely cease to exist.
