#dmake

dmake is a build automation tool that I created after borking my MinGW/msys installation. As the name suggests, it is an alternative to make and cmake. See https://sites.google.com/site/tomvandijkhuizen/projects/dmake for more information and background

#Notes

dmake relies on a serialisation library that is currently not available to the public. Said library is undergoing substantial changes and will be released upon completion.
